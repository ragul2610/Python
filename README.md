                                                Introduction to Python Programming

"Develop proficiency in Python programming by mastering fundamental concepts and syntax, including variables, data types,
control structures, functions, and basic problem-solving skills.Create simple Python programs to solve common computational tasks
and gain a solid foundation for more advanced Python development."Learnt the problem-solving techniques to decompose a problem
into computational steps and translate them into a program using Python.

This objective focuses on building a strong foundation in Python programming and sets the stage for further learning and development in the language.

Concepts covered:

              1)Decision Making With Conditional Statements.

              2)Iterative Statements and List Operations.
              
              3)Looping Over Data Structures.
              
              4)Writing Modular Programs in Python.
